# Plant Disease Classification Model

A full-stack plant disease detection system targeting fungal leaf diseases in the most cultivated crops in Albania and Europe. Built using **FastAPI** (backend), **React + TailwindCSS** (frontend), and a fine-tuned **MobileNetV2** deep learning model served via **TensorFlow Serving**.

---

##  Overview

Fungal diseases account for ~85% of all plant diseases, with devastating impacts such as the historic **Irish Potato Famine**. This project supports farmers, agricultural researchers and plant enthusiasts by providing an accessible tool to detect the most common fungal diseases across:

- Corn
- Grape
- Olive
- Potato
- Tomato
- Wheat

The model classifies 19 leaf classes including healthy leaves and 12 major fungal diseases in Europe.

## Machine Learning

- **Model**: Fine-tuned `MobileNetV2`
- **Framework**: TensorFlow
- **Input Size**: 224x224 RGB
- **Training Data**: Custom dataset (available in repo)
- **Augmentation**: Applied across all classes
- **Number of Classes**: 19
- **Validation Accuracy**: **94%** (Model v3)
